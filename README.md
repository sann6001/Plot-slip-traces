# Plot-slip-traces
This script reads the GND density output from ABAQUS and plot the slip traces of the most active slip system. 

In the ABAQUS output, grain rotation matrix should be included. 

The output .rpt should be converted to .xlsx format using comma and space as delimiter.

slip_traces.m is the main function and function slip_systems.m contains main slip systems in Ti.

Two examples files were given for test.
